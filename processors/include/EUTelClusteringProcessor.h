  //! Clustering processor for the EUTelescope
  /*! This processor is used to search within the current data matrix
   *  (after pedestal subtraction and eventual common mode
   *  suppression) for clusters. In this contest a cluster is a group
   *  of neighboring pixels, fulfilling certain conditions and
   *  representing the signal produced in the detector by the passage
   *  of a particle. Hence, clustering is then considered the first
   *  step in a tracking procedure.
   *
   *  To obtain space points from clusters, the actual geometrical
   *  description of the sensors (pixel pitches, definition of the
   *  local frame of reference, relation to the global frame of
   *  reference are required. Moreover, a suitable algorithm to
   *  calculate the cluster center, in a linear (charge center of
   *  gravity) or non-linear (eta function) is needed.
   *
   *  There are different ways to build up a clusters: the user can
   *  choose which algorithm to use via the clusteringAlgo
   *  parameter. Different algorithms may requires different way to
   *  store, at least temporary, the cluster information in
   *  memory. For example, in the case of fixed frame NxM clustering
   *  the natural object to store a cluster is a EUTelFFClusterImpl
   *  object but all of them should inherit from the
   *  EUTelVirtualCluster, that is the base cluster class in the
   *  EUTelescope framework. All these classes are working according
   *  to the Decorator Pattern, and they have at least a TrackerData
   *  pointer as data member.
   *
   *  In order to write data on disk in the most general and
   *  consistent way, whatever object has been used during the
   *  clustering procedure to store cluster info, those are then moved
   *  to a TrackPulse before writing. The original information about
   *  the TrackerData is saved as a reference in the TrackerPulse for
   *  possible further use.
   *
   *  The TrackerPulse cell id encoding is very similar to the
   *  EUTELESCOPE::CLUSTERDEFAULTENCODING but instead of having the
   *  quality, it has another field named ClusterType used to identify
   *  the class used to store the cluster information.
   *
   *  @see processEvent(LCEvent*) for a detailed description of
   *  available algorithms.
   *
   *  <h4>Input collections</h4>
   *
   *  <b>Data collection</b>: the input data TrackerData collection
   *  name. This collection is containing data pedestal subtracted
   *  and, eventually, common mode corrected
   *
   *  <b>Noise collections</b>: the noise TrackerData collection
   *  name as read from the Condition Processor. This object contains
   *  the noise information of all pixels in all telescope
   *  detectors. Those numbers are used to calculate seed and cluster
   *  signal to noise ratio.
   *
   *  <b>Status collection</b>: the status TrackerData collection
   *  name as read from the Condition Processor. This object is used
   *  to exclude from the clustering procedure pixels defined as bad
   *  during the pedestal processor.
   *
   *  <h4>Output collections</h4>
   *
   *  <b>Pulse collection</b>: this is the TrackerPulse collection
   *  containing all clusters found in the event.
   *
   *  @param DataCollectionName The name of the input data collection.
   *
   *  @param NoiseCollectionName The name of the noise collection.
   *
   *  @param StatusCollectionName The name of the status collection.
   *
   *  @param PulseCollectionName The name of the output TrackerPulse collection.
   *
   *  @param ClusteringAlgo  This is a string representing which algorithm
   *  should be used for the clustering procedure.
   *
   *  @param ClusterSizeX The maximum size of the cluster in pixel
   *  unit along the x direction. It is used only for
   *  EUTELESCOPE::FIXEDFRAME algorithm. It has to be an odd number
   *  since the seed pixel is bound to be the cluster center.
   *
   *  @param ClusterSizeY As the ClusterSizeX but along the y
   *  direction.
   *
   *  @param SeedPixelCut This is the SNR threshold used to identify seed
   *  pixel candidates. One global number for all detectors.
   *
   *  @param ClusterCut  This is the SNR threshold used to accept cluster
   *  candidates.
   *
   *  @param HistoInfoFileName This is the name of the XML file
   *  containing the histogram booking information.
   *
   *  @since Since version v00-00-09, this processor requires GEAR to
   *  be initialized because the geometry information are no more
   *  taken from the input file Run Header but they are gathered from
   *  the GEAR description.

    //! Method for fixed frame clustering
    /*! This method is called by the processEvent method in the case
     *  the user selected the EUTELESCOPE::FIXEDFRAME algorithm for
     *  clustering.
     *
     *  This algorithm is based on the reconstruction of clusters
     *  having a rectangular predefined maximum shape centered around
     *  the seed pixel. The seed pixel is defined as the one with the
     *  highest signal. Here follows a brief description of the algorithm:
     *
     *  \li The full data matrix is scanned searching for seed pixel
     *  candidates. A seed candidate is defined as a pixel with a
     *  signal to noise ratio in excess the
     *  EUTelClusteringProcessor::_seedPixelCut defined by the
     *  user. All candidates are added to a vector< pair< float, int > >
     *  (EUTelClusteringProcessor::_seedCandidateMap) where the first
     *  template element is the (float) pixel charge and the second is
     *  the pixel index.
     *
     *  \li This is the sorted using the std::algorithm library by the first element of the pair
     *  i.e. the pixel signal. In this way, at the end of
     *  the matrix crossing, the last element of the map is the pixel
     *  seed candidate with the highest signal. The seed candidate map has to be compulsory sorted,
     *  because the cluster building procedure has to start from a
     *  seed pixel.
     *
     *  \li Starting from the last entry of the seed candidate map
     *  (i.e. the pixel with the highest signal in the matrix), a
     *  candidate cluster is built around this seed. The clustering is
     *  done with two nested loops in way that the seed pixel is the
     *  center of the resulting cluster. Only pixels with a good
     *  status, effectively belonging to the matrix (1) and not yet
     *  belonging to the any other clusters are added to the current
     *  cluster candidate. //TODO: (Phillip Hamnett) CHECK THIS
     *
     *  \li A cluster candidate is finally accepted as a good cluster
     *  if its SNR is passing the _clusterCut threshold. Each good
     *  cluster is added to the current event using a TrackerData
     *  class. The cellID encoding used is the
     *  EUTELESCOPE::CLUSTERDEFAULTENCODING where along with the
     *  detector number, also the cluster id, the seed pixel
     *  coordinates and the cluster sizes are stored so that the
     *  cluster can be reconstructed.
     *
     *  (1) The 2D coordinates of each pixel are determined using the
     *  pixel index information along with the size along X of the
     *  matrix. For this purpose, some utility methods have been
     *  defined; those methods don't perform any consistency check of
     *  the obtained results. This means that the use of such methods
     *  can result into pixel coordinates outside the actual valid
     *  range. For this reason, during the clustering, a check on the
     *  validity of the x, y pair is required.
