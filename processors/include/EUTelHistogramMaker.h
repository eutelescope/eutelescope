  //! Histogram filler for EUTelescope
  /*! This processor has the task to fill many control histograms that
   *  can serve as benchmark to understand if the detectors are
   *  working or not.
   *
   *  In the output histogram file, the user will find a folder for
   *  each of the detector in the telescope and a bunch of histograms
   *  described here below:
   *
   *  @li <b> Cluster Signal </b> (histo name = "clusterSignal"). This
   *  is a cluster spectrum using all the pixels in the cluster.
   *
   *  @li <b> Cluster Signal N x N </b> (histo name =
   *  "clusterSignal3x3" and "clusterSignal4x4"). Those two histograms
   *  are the cluster spectrum considering only the pixels contained
   *  into the 5x5 and 3x3 sub-matrix around the seed. Those pixels
   *  are not sorted!
   *
   *  @li <b> Cluster Signal N </b> (histo name = "clusterSignalN"
   *  with N an integer number). Those histograms are the cluster
   *  spectrum considering only the N most significant pixels.
   *
   *  @li <b> Seed pixel signal </b> (histo name = "seedSignal"). This
   *  is the signal spectrum of the highest pixel in the cluster. This
   *  is the place to look for the calibration peak.

   *  @li <b> Hit map</b> (histo name = "hitMap"). This is a 2D plot
   *  with each bin representing one pixel in the sensor. The number
   *  of entries for each bin corresponds to the number of times a
   *  seed pixel has been found on that pixel.
   *
   *  <h4>Input collections </h4>
   *  A tracker pulse collection with clusters to be histogrammed.
   *
   *  @param PulseCollectionName The name of the TrackerPulse input
   *  collection.
   *
   *  @param HistoInfoFileName The name of the XML information file
   *  with the histogram booking information.
   *
   *  @param ClusterNxN A vector containing the cluster N x N spectra to be
   *  filled
   *
   *  @param ClusterN A vector containing the cluster N spectra to be filled.
   *
   *  <h4>Output collections </h4>
   *
   *  None
