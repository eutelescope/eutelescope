//! Implementation of the EUTelescope raw tracker data structure.
/*! This is the interface class for the raw data access class.
 *  It is used to interface the data stored in a LCIO::TrackerData
 *  via the pixel classes introduced in EUTelescope.
 *  For the implementation see: EUTelTrackerDataInterfacerImpl
 *  Given that different pixel types store a different amount of 
 *  information, the implemantations have to be templated in the pixel type.
 *  Different specializations for various pixel typed have to be 
 *  introduced. EUTelescope cliuster classes are intended to make use of 
 *  this interfacing class, thus it being the centrally managed piece
 *  of code, determined to interfacer LCIO::TrackerData.
 *  This abstract class was introduced to allow for polymorphic usage 
 *  of EUTelTrackerDataInterfacerImpl. It allows to retrieve 
 *  EUTelBaseSparsePixel without actually knowing the pixel type 
 *  (obviously the correct EUTelTrackerDataImpl hast to be 
 *  instantiated somehow)
