This application performs statistical tests on distributions contained in a ROOT file.
Distributions can be binned (i.e. histograms) or unbinned (not yet ready).
Which tests to run and conditions to define failure/success are controlled thorugh a configuration file.
See example/testconf.qa for an example of a configuration format.
The basic idea is to check a distribution against a reference contained in a second file. The structure of the reference
file should be exactly the same as the input file.

Available statistical tests are contained in the Tests module. To see a list of all available tests:
  runtests.py --list

To run the application:

   runtests.py <conffile> <inputfile> [<referencefile>]

The third parameter: referencefile if present overwrites the value specified in the conffile
(It can be useful to run several times the testing against different referneces without changing the conffile)

Directory example contains a test file with 3 histograms a reference file and and example of configuration file.
cp example/* .
runtests.py testconf.qa test.root
