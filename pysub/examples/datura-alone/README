This directory contains an example configuration for the Datura
telescope with six planes of Mimosa26 without DUT.

This example is based on a test beam campaign done in May 2012 at DESY
by the DESY CMS pixel group.

The corresponding data can be found at:
/afs/desy.de/group/telescopes/EutelTestData/TestExampleDaturaAlone

If you are interested in the data but cannot access the above path,
please contact the EUTelescope software coordinators.


Features of this configuration:
------------------------------

- telescope alone, no DUT


Known issues:
------------

- does not use the reference vector framework for identifying a sensor
  plane corresponding to a hit; therefore, planes are identified by
  their z-coordinate which could lead to problems if this
  configuration is used in geometries with overlapping sensor layers
  (in z)

- lacks an thorough analysis of the data, e.g. using telescope planes
  as DUT and determining the resolution
