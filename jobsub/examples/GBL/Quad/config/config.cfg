# The python config parser interprets '%(NAME)s' as the corresponding variable
# NAME. The variable 'eutelescopepath' is by default filled with the environment
# variable EUTELESCOPE and should correspond to the installation path of
# EUTelescope. Also, the variable '%(home)s' corresponds to the user's home
# directory. The template file name can be set with TemplateFile = file.xml. The
# default is '[task]-tmp.xml'
