#This is the an example with two 250x50 FEI4 DUTs in a high radiation length enviroment. 
#Note that planes with ID > 99 will be assumed to be radiation length and does not have to be included in the plane IDs for resolution and dimensions.
#Radiation length of this system is well over 22%. 400 cm X0 poly and 5 cm width on both sides of the DUTs.
#Using 10k but will increase this to 100k for the final alignment so use the full data set from the beginning.
#Hotpixels for the APIX are not removed must load this into clustering. The data is clean and pattern recognition will remove this implicitly there. 
#Number of tracks decreases at about 15k event. I would guess sync problems since there are still hits for these events.

Gear used from the start is prealigned. However you should be able to start with a non prealigned gear and follow the same procedure

Prealignment must have the additional IDs excluded and included in thew residual vector!!!!!
Note used for this run but for others could be. Millepede can also be used to do prealignment.

Another iteration. Must be some addition radiation length in scatters since 20 micron resolution fit.
