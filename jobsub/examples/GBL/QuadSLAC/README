Do prealignment with bot DUTs in the centre and then move back in _pre. Only have to do this once for each new geometry.
MUST MAKE SURE PREALIGNMENT HAS WORKED CHECK HISTOGRAMS: Prealignment works by looking for a peak in matching the global X/Y axis of each sensor to the first.
If there are many peaks in this distribution then the wrong position will be chosen. This will lead to the wrong hits been selected on the DUT by pattern recognition.
The DUT window histogram should have a peak near 0. If not then the prealignment could be wrong which is a particular problem for SLAC. If you find the right hits then the rest can be taken care of in millepede and GBL.

DUT 21 has no correlation with any orientation. This might be a mistake but remove from fit since we are interest in the QUAD.

Alignment in one iteration. So change gear to:alignedGear-iter1-run000365.xml (Note this is what I called it. Use another name)

#js GBLTrackFit 365
About 1 track per event found. This is not the same of the other runs were 8 tracks are found. 
This will produce GBL trajectories and ROOT NTuple.

A small track multiplicity. Need to combine data or loosen up pattern recognition if you need more statistics.
