This is the example full analysis and reconstruction of a strip sensor DUT with
an ALiBaVa readout.

=============================================================================

Folder contents:

/gearfiles:

  Contains gear files for various setup scenarios. gear_alibava_aA_bB_cC_dD.xml 
is a setup with the strip sensor DUT of thickness D at a rotation angle alpha 
of A, rotation angle beta of B and rotation angle gamma of C. All included 
files have the same telescope setup, but this can be changed to your needs. 
gear_alibava_eda.xml is for a scenario where the sensitive DUT coordinate is 
rotated by 90 degrees (here: along the x-axis). gear_alibava_ref.xml and 
gear_alibava_ref_38.xml are for scenarios where a reference plane is used. 
gear_telescope.xml is for the DUT-free case.

/histoinfo:

  Contains XML files for histogram ranges and boundaries. This is mostly for 
legacy processors.

/output:

  The output created by the EUTelescope processors will be written to the 
subfolders herein.

/steering-templates:

  This folder contains the steering templates used to control the processors. 
They are explained further on.

/config.cfg:

  The configuration file. Data paths should be changed, other settings should 
work for most scenarios.

/runlist.csv:

  A file containing the information of the runs to be processed. Run-specific 
parameters are read from this file. It can also be parsed by the scripts for 
running multiple runs.

/README:

  This file.

/x_<name>.sh:

  Scripts for performing a specific task on one run. They should be called with 
sh scriptname.sh <runnumber> . Further information is in the scripts.

/z_<name>.sh:

  Similar scripts that parse the runlist.csv and thus loop over all (or a 
certain subset of runs) therein. Again, further information is in each script.
