=============================================================================

This is the example full analysis and reconstruction of two strip sensors as
DUTs, read out with one or multiple CBC chips.

Folder contents:

/gearfiles:

  Contains gear files for various setup scenarios. 

/output:

  The output created by the EUTelescope processors will be written to the 
subfolders herein.

/steering-templates:

  This folder contains the steering templates used to control the processors. 
They are explained further on.

/config.cfg:

  The configuration file. Data paths should be changed, other settings should 
work for most scenarios.

/runlist.csv:

  A file containing the information of the runs to be processed. Run-specific 
parameters are read from this file. It can also be parsed by the scripts for 
running multiple runs.

/README:

  This file.

/x_<name>.sh:

  Scripts for performing a specific task on one run. They should be called with 
sh scriptname.sh <runnumber> . Further information is in the scripts.

/z_<name>.sh:

  Similar scripts that parse the runlist.csv and thus loop over all (or a 
certain subset of runs) therein. Again, further information is in each script.
