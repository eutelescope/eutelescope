******* PLEASE NOTE *******
This example mainly demonstrates how to set up a test case for
EUTelescope development. The steering-templates are based on older
pysub-templates and have not been optimized.

This directory contains an example configuration for the Datura
telescope with six planes of Mimosa26 without DUT.

This example is based on a test beam campaign done in May 2012 at DESY
by the DESY CMS pixel group.

The corresponding data can be found at:
/afs/desy.de/group/telescopes/EutelTestData/TestExampleDaturaAlone

If you are interested in the data but cannot access the above path,
please contact the EUTelescope software coordinators.


Features of this configuration:
------------------------------

- telescope alone, no DUT data
- "passive material" (CMS pixel sensor+ROC, socket, and PCB) in between telescope arms


Known issues:
------------

- does not use the reference vector framework for identifying a sensor
  plane corresponding to a hit; therefore, planes are identified by
  their z-coordinate which could lead to problems if this
  configuration is used in geometries with overlapping sensor layers
  (in z)

- no actual data analysis is performed in this example
